  I intent for this project to become a collection of technologies that can be interconnected.
Similar to how Internet-of-Things solutions involve different running parts for achieving one goal, 
as such i want my software making environment to be as versatile as possible. 

  One obvious start impediment is going past the first couple of hello-world projects
  until you find a tool that does the job.

  The percentage of availability of one component can be determined by the color of one's title. 

    \textcolor {red} {bright  colors} means more relevant to this  \textcolor {orange} {iteration}.

    \textcolor {brown} {neutral colors} suggests the component's state of integrity and integration.

    \textcolor {gray} {non-colors} and you're looking at a component that hasn't been integrated yet.

  Future expansion possibilities are in \textcolor {white} {white} color. 


  \begin{itemize}
    \item  \textcolor {brown} { \textbf { FrontEnd ( PyQt   GUI programming interface)} } \\
    \textcolor {gray}   { integration dispatch layer  }
    \item \textcolor {red}    { Backend  ( Python Machine Learning Interface) } \\
      \textcolor {gray}   { communication socket }
    \item \textcolor {orange} { \textbf { Backend  ( C/C++  Render Engine,Math Engine) } }

    \textcolor {white}  { ROBOTICS / ARDUINO / PIE integration }
    % \item \textcolor {gray}   { FrontEnd ( web app ) }
    % \hline \textcolor {gray}   { integration dispatch layer  }

\part*{The backend}

  There are two main languages used in this backend implementation:

  % \hline
  % \hspace{10}

  in C/C++  we have: Rendering Engine, Vectorial MathEngine, GameEngine.

  in Python we have: pyqt editor, Bash File Manager, Machine Learning Interface, Django.

\part*{The Frontend}

  % This too, 
  % splits into two.

  % The software application and The web application.

  % As of writing this, no demonstrabable movement had been done in the web application department. 
  % The team lead suggests building software solutions that can be easily imported into web applications without needing to re-implement. Research had been done into webGL integration and the low-level graphics calls we use from opengl are compatible with webgl as well. 
  % There are even resources involving qt and pyqt integration. As of writing this, all of the GUI work had been done in the qt environment.
