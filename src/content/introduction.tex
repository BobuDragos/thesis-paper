Non-Player Characters (NPCs) serve as guides for players and act as extensions of the game designers within the game world. Consequently, it is crucial for NPCs to have fluid dialogue that maintains the illusion of choice without easily breaking it.

Currently, dialogue trees are the predominant solution for managing NPC interactions. While effective, dialogue trees can still feel somewhat rigid and may disrupt the immersion when players are limited to selecting from a set of predefined responses.
