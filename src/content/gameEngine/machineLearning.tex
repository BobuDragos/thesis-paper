\subsection*{Machine Learning Integration}

It is common for companies to develop their own in-house game engines and subsequently build their applications on these platforms. However, the integration of pre-installed machine learning components is less prevalent.

Typically, integrating machine learning into games involves installing complex extensions over pre-existing game engines.

\subsubsection*{inWorld AI}
InWorld AI is an example of such a service. It provides installable extensions for popular game engines and offers an interface for communicating with pre-trained OpenAI agents. This solution is excellent for facilitating human-to-AI communication, making it ideal for dialogues and NPC integration.

\subsubsection*{Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior}

Another notable example is this research paper that successfully trained multiple ML agents to interact within a pre-created world. These agents are capable of remembering conversations and interactions and can even organize activities amongst themselves.

By integrating these advanced machine learning solutions, game developers can significantly enhance the immersion and interactivity of their NPCs, creating more engaging and dynamic gameplay experiences.
