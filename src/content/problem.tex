\section*{Problem Statement}

\textbf{Definition Setup:}

Let \( S \) denote a software entity. The function \( \text{isGameEngine}(S) \) outputs true if \( S \) qualifies as a game engine based on the following criteria:

\[
\text{isGameEngine}(S) \equiv \text{isFramework}(S) \land (\{ S.\text{components} \} \subseteq \text{GE::E})
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \text{isFramework}(S) \) indicates that \( S \) is classified as a software framework.
    \item \( \text{GE::E} \) represents the set of components common to various game engines, defined as:
    \[
    \text{GE::E} = \bigcup_{G_i \in \text{GameEngines}} \{ (G_i, C_j) \mid C_j \in \{ G_i.\text{components} \} \}
    \]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Scenario:}

Assume a scenario where a company is developing a new game engine, \( GG \), which includes the following components: MathEngine (M), RendererEngine (R), GUI Editor (E), and File Manager (FM).

1. Define \( GG \) as:
\[
GG = \{ M, R, E, FM \}
\]

\textbf{Tasks:}

a) \textbf{Verification of Game Engine Status:}

Verify whether \( GG \) qualifies as a game engine based on the formal definition.


\section*{Solutions}

\textbf{Solution to Task (a):}

To verify if \( GG \) is a game engine:
\[
\text{isGameEngine}(GG) \equiv \text{isFramework}(GG) \land (\{ GG.\text{components} \} \subseteq \text{GE::E})
\]

Given \( GG = \{ M, R, E, FM \} \):

\[
\text{isGameEngine}(GG) \equiv \text{isFramework}(GG) \land (\{ M, R, E, FM \} \subseteq \text{GE::E})
\]

Since \( GG \) includes components that are standard across various game engines (MathEngine, RendererEngine, GUI Editor, File Manager), and assuming \( \text{isFramework}(GG) \) is true (given the context), \( GG \) satisfies the criteria and is classified as a game engine.

\subsection*{Problem 2: Enhancing Game Engine with Machine Learning Capabilities}

\subsubsection*{Formal Definition}
Let \( \text{GE} \) denote a game engine with components \( \{ \text{Probabilities Engine}, \text{ID3 Generation}, \text{Modular Architecture} \} \).

\subsubsection*{Natural Language Understanding}
Integrating machine learning capabilities into \( \text{GE} \) enhances its ability to predict outcomes, analyze data patterns, and support decision-making processes within games.

\subsubsection*{Machine Learning Integration}
To enhance \( \text{GE} \) with machine learning capabilities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Probabilities Engine}: Implement algorithms to calculate probabilities for in-game events and decisions.
    \item \textbf{ID3 Generation}: Develop decision tree algorithms for automated decision-making based on game state and player interactions.
    \item \textbf{Modularity}: Leverage \( \text{GE} \)'s modular architecture to integrate popular Python solutions for machine learning, such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
    \item \textbf{Adaptation}: Customize and adapt existing Python libraries to work seamlessly within \( \text{GE} \)'s framework, ensuring compatibility and performance optimization.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Formal Proof}
Define \( \text{ML}(GE) \) as the machine learning enhanced version of \( \text{GE} \):
\[
\text{ML}(GE) = \text{GE} + \text{ML\_Components}
\]
Where \( \text{ML\_Components} \) includes modules and functionalities for machine learning integration tailored to \( \text{GE} \)'s requirements.
