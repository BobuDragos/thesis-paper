% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Game engines provide the foundation for creating interactive digital experiences.
%     \item Machine Learning is a real Game Changer, promising a lot of advancements in almost every field.
%     \item For the past couple of years, the most advancements in the game development ecosystem were made in graphics.
%     \item Many significant breakthroughs had also been achieved in gameplay.
%     \item Not so many improvements on the Narrative.
%     \item Not anymore.
    
%     \item Transformers for Text Generation ( like ChatGPT ) can and will bring a huge innovation in the narrative component of games.
%     \item So there is a gap in the current game development ecosystem. A gap that sooner or later will be filled by the corporate giants. ( NVDA already working a lot on ai stuff... )
%     \item Although there are already many solutions on the market for artificial intelligence driven dialogue.
%     % ( Inworld Origins or https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf )  ( Solutions which I'm going to use for inspiration as well) 
%     At the moment of publishing this, there is no comprehensive game engine that can seamlessly integrate machine learning capabilities.
%     \item My reasearch aims to design, develop, and evaluate a game engine that incorporates GPT-based machine learning capabilities. I want to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of this approach through the creation of practical game examples.
