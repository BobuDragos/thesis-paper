  The goal is to build an Abstraction Layer that opens the inner workings of computer graphics and machine learning.

  This Abstraction Layer \textbf{must} respect PHIGS standards, \textbf{must} be easy-to-learn for both intermediate and beginner end-users, \textbf{must} present shorter and more straight-forward solution than existing solutions.

  The project's theme is combining Machine Learning with the Game Makers' Environments and standards.

  In the following i will present the benefits of this theme.
