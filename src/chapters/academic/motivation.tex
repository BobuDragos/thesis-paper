  In the previous i mentioned the toolbox that this university allowed me to organise for myself. In the following i will go over some of the tools i specifically tailered for this implementation.

  The biggest motivator factor for persuing this project is a strong personal interest in the field of game development and computer graphics.

  My goal became to apply some of those concepts aquired during my study in my personal research.

  The way i chose to apply these concepts is by building a graphics framework compatible with some of the simpler machine learning solutions.
