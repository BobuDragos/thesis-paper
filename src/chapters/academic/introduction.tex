    What you are about to read is over 5 years of game engines research combined with my recently gained machine learning experience aquired as part of my bachelors programme. 

    Each part acts as an introduction to the one following it. You are now reading about the academic influence that lead to this extended study.

    Of course, machine learning wasn't the only knowledge i gained during my bachelors study. I also take pride of myself for actively improving my Software Engineering and Object-Oriented-Programming knowledge, my System Design and Management skills and Computer Graphics and Computational Geometry understanding. 

    Besides the knowledges, i have gained much experience working with industry-standard tools. There were courses where the main goal was a specific programming language understanding. Courses like Python Programming, OOP, Python Programming, PLP and many many more. Courses like this made me an agile handyman that has his toolbox in order.
